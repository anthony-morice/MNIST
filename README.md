## MNIST
This repository contains an MNIST image/label parser and
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier written from scratch in C++. 

OpenCV is used to view and normalize images; the googletest framework is used
for unit testing; OpenMP is used to parallelize MLP training; CBLAS is used for
matrix multiplications; and CMake is used as the build system.

MNIST data files can be found at

## Build

```
cd scripts
./build.sh
```
## Run

To train a model from scratch...
```
cd scripts
./run.sh
```

To train a model from a checkpoint...
```

./run.sh load-mlp <path-to-checkpoint>
```

Or to load an existing model and evaluate on test images...
```
cd scripts
./run.sh test-mlp <path-to-checkpoint>
