This repository contains an MNIST image/label parser and
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier written from scratch in C++. 

OpenCV is used to view and normalize images; the googletest framework is used
for unit testing; OpenMP is used to parallelize MLP training; CBLAS is used for
matrix multiplications; and CMake is used as the build system.

MNIST data files can be found at
